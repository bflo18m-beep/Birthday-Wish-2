# Birthday-Wish-2
To create the virtual birthday card, I designed and coded a web-based email-style page using semantic HTML and external CSS. I structured the layout with proper elements such as <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to mimic the look and feel of a heartfelt birthday email. I then added visual and interactive media, including three gift-themed GIFs, an autoplaying video using the required autoplay muted loop playsinline attributes, and a second video with user controls and explicit height and width settings.

In the CSS file, I handled the entire visual design using flexbox layouts, media queries, hover effects, accessible color contrast, and spacing choices that make the message feel warm and polished. I also ensured the project met accessibility standards by adding alt text, labels, caption tracks, and keyboard-visible focus styles. The final step was creating a README file that explains how to open the project and documents the limitations of GIFs and video support in real email clients, clarifying that this is a simulated email experience built for the web.
